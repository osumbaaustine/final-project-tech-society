                            What are video games?
                            
                            A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion-sensing device – to generate visual feedback. (Wikipedia)
                            Video games are defined based on their platform, which includes arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Engineer Ralph Baer AKA the Father of games, in the 1960s, Ralph saw how technology could be used for more than passively watching television shows. In 1966 while working on Sanders Associates Inc he began to investigate video games and how to play games on television. Between 1967 and 1969, he and colleagues Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch created several video game test units. This result was the “Brown Box,” a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system. Ralph Baer donated his video game test units, production models, notes, and schematics to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 2006.
Starting from the first video game other engineers started developing more advanced video games.

                        <h2>How do video games affect society?</h2>
    
                        <p>
                            The increasing number of people playing video games means that
                        <a> video games are having an undeniable effect on culture.</a> This effect is clearly visible in the increasing mainstream acceptance of aspects of gaming culture. Video games have also changed the way that many other forms of media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Educational institutions have embraced the use of video games as valuable tools for teaching. These tools include simulated worlds in which important life skills can be learned and improved. While video games may not be accepted by everyone as a form of art, there is no doubt that they contribute greatly to artistic media such as music and film.

                                Video gaming is found to be associated with positive emotions and social relationships while playing. However, problematic and excessive video gaming is also associated with maladaptive coping strategies, negative emotions and attitudes, low self-esteem, loneliness, and poor academic performance.

                            Video games can act as distractions from pain and psychological trauma. Video games can also help people who are dealing with mental disorders like anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                            There is also a study where video games can help the brain in a number of ways, such as enhanced visual perception, improved ability to switch between tasks, and better information processing.
                            So you can see how video games affect humans both positively and negatively.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
    
                        <p>
                            The aesthetics and principles of gaming culture have had an increasing effect on mainstream culture. This has led to the gradual acceptance of marginalized social groups and increased comfort with virtual worlds and the pursuit of new means of interaction.
                            Video games have gone from being a derivative medium that took its cues from other media, such as books, films, and music, to be a form of media that other types derive new ideas from. Video games have also interacted with older forms of media to change them and create new means of entertainment and interaction. Jobs for gamers are as varied as the games themselves. Jobs for gamers are about as varied as the games themselves, from software testers and technical artists to web developers, account managers, and consumer marketing positions. And right about now would be a great time to check out jobs at gaming companies.
